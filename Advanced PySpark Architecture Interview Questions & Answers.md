# Advanced PySpark Architecture Interview Questions & Answers

### 1. Explain the role of SparkSession in PySpark architecture.
Answer:
- SparkSession is the unified entry point for PySpark applications.
- It internally creates a SparkContext and SQLContext (or HiveContext when needed).
- Benefits:
  - Combines DataFrame, SQL, and RDD API into a single object.
  - Manages configuration (e.g., memory allocation, shuffle partitions).
  - Handles catalog metadata for SQL queries.
- Example:
```
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("MyApp").getOrCreate()
```

### 2. How does the PySpark driver program interact with the cluster manager?
Answer:
- The driver program:
  1. Creates SparkContext inside SparkSession.
  2. Talks to the cluster manager (YARN, Mesos, or Standalone) to request executors.
  3. Sends tasks (serialized Python bytecode + data) to executors.
- The cluster manager allocates resources and monitors executor health.
- Executors run tasks and return results to the driver.

### 3. How does PySpark handle Python-to-JVM communication?
Answer:
- PySpark runs on top of the JVM-based Spark core.
- Communication uses Py4J, a bridge between Python and Java.
- Process flow:
  1. Python driver sends commands via Py4J to the JVM.
  2. The JVM Spark engine executes the job.
  3. Results are sent back to Python via socket-based communication.
 
### 4. What is the role of the DAG Scheduler in PySpark?
Answer:
- The DAG Scheduler converts the logical execution plan (from Catalyst Optimizer) into a physical plan of stages.
- Each stage contains tasks that can be executed in parallel.
- Responsibilities:
  1. Breaking down RDD transformations into stages at shuffle boundaries.
  2. Scheduling tasks for each stage.
  3. Handling retries on failures.
 
### 5. Explain how Catalyst Optimizer works in PySpark SQL.
Answer:
- Catalyst Optimizer is a query optimization framework inside Spark SQL.
- Steps:
  1. Parse SQL/DataFrame query into an unresolved logical plan.
  2. Analyze with schema & catalog metadata → resolved logical plan.
  3. Optimize: applies rule-based & cost-based optimizations (predicate pushdown, column pruning).
  4. Translate to physical plan and generate RDD execution plan.
  5. Advantage: Automatic optimization without manual tuning.
 
### 6. What is the difference between Narrow and Wide transformations in PySpark?
Answer:
- Narrow Transformations:
  - Data required for output partition comes from a single input partition.
  - Example: map, filter, mapPartitions.
  - No shuffle.
- Wide Transformations:
  - Data required for output partition comes from multiple input partitions.
  -  Example: groupByKey, reduceByKey, join.
  - Causes shuffle → expensive operation.
 
### 7. How does Spark handle task parallelism?
Answer:
- Spark splits a job into stages → tasks → runs them in parallel on executors.
- Task parallelism depends on:
  1. Number of partitions in RDD/DataFrame.
  2. Available executor cores.
- Example: If dataset has 100 partitions and 10 cores, Spark runs 10 tasks concurrently until all are completed.

### 8. What is the role of Broadcast variables in PySpark architecture?
Answer:
- Broadcast variables send a read-only copy of data to each executor only once, rather than sending it with every task.
- Reduces network overhead.
- Example:
  ```
  broadcastVar = spark.sparkContext.broadcast([1, 2, 3])
  ```

### 9. How is data persisted in PySpark?
Answer:
- Persistence allows RDD/DataFrame to be cached in memory or stored on disk for reuse.
- Storage levels: MEMORY_ONLY, MEMORY_AND_DISK, DISK_ONLY.
- Example:
  ```
  df.persist()  # default MEMORY_AND_DISK
  ```
### 10. What are shuffle operations and why are they expensive?
Answer:
- Shuffle = redistributing data across executors during wide transformations.
- Cost factors:
  1. Disk I/O for intermediate data.
  2. Network transfer between executors.
  3. Serialization/deserialization overhead.
- Optimizations:
  - Reduce shuffle partitions (spark.sql.shuffle.partitions).
  -  Use map-side aggregations.
 
### 11. What is the role of SparkSession in PySpark, and how does it relate to SparkContext?
Answer:
- SparkSession is the entry point to PySpark applications from Spark 2.0 onward. It unifies SparkContext, SQLContext, and HiveContext into a single object.
- Internally, SparkSession creates a SparkContext that handles communication with the cluster manager and resource allocation.
- Example:
  ```
  from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
  spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Example").getOrCreate()
  ```
- SparkContext is still accessible via:
  ```
  sc = spark.sparkContext
  ```

### 12. How does PySpark execute a job from code to execution on a cluster?
Answer:
1. User Code: Python code using DataFrame/RDD API is written.
2. Logical Plan: Catalyst Optimizer creates an optimized logical plan.
3. Physical Plan: Translates logical plan into execution plan (stages & tasks).
4. Cluster Manager: SparkContext requests executors from YARN/Mesos/K8s.
5. Task Execution: Executors run tasks and return results to the driver.

### 13. Explain the concept of narrow and wide transformations in PySpark architecture.
Answer:
- Narrow Transformations: Data required for each output partition is from a single input partition (e.g., map, filter). No shuffling.
- Wide Transformations: Data required for each output partition is from multiple input partitions (e.g., groupBy, reduceByKey). Requires shuffle.
- Shuffling involves disk I/O, network transfer, and is expensive.

### 14. How does PySpark handle data serialization between driver and executors?
Answer:
- PySpark uses Py4J to communicate between Python and JVM.
- Serialization between driver & executors is handled by:
  - Pickle or CloudPickle (Python objects)
  - Java serialization for JVM objects
- Choosing an efficient serializer (KryoSerializer) can improve performance.

### 15. What is the role of Catalyst Optimizer in PySpark?
Answer:
- Catalyst Optimizer is the query optimizer for Spark SQL.
- Steps:
  1. Parse SQL/DataFrame code into an unresolved logical plan.
  2. Analyze and resolve attributes using catalog metadata.
  3. Optimize logical plan (predicate pushdown, constant folding).
  4. Generate Physical Plan for execution.
 
### 16. Explain how PySpark manages memory.
Answer:
- Memory is divided into:
  - Execution Memory: For shuffles, joins, aggregations.
  - Storage Memory: For caching/persisting RDDs/DataFrames.
- Both share the same pool by default (spark.memory.fraction).
- Managed via Unified Memory Management (UMM) since Spark 1.6.

### 17. What happens when an executor fails in PySpark?
Answer:
- Spark retries failed tasks (spark.task.maxFailures default = 4).
- If an executor is lost:
  - Cluster manager (YARN/K8s) launches a replacement executor.
  - Cached data in the lost executor is recomputed if needed.
  - The DAG scheduler reschedules failed tasks on other executors.

### 18. How does PySpark handle data locality in execution?
Answer:
- Spark prefers to schedule tasks close to the data:
  - PROCESS_LOCAL → same JVM
  - NODE_LOCAL → same node, different JVM
  - RACK_LOCAL → same rack
  - ANY → no locality
- This minimizes network data transfer.

### 19. Explain the difference between a job, stage, and task in PySpark.
Answer:
- Job: Triggered by an action (count, collect).
- Stage: Subdivision of a job, separated by shuffle boundaries.
- Task: The smallest unit of execution, processes a single partition of data.

### 20. How does PySpark handle large data shuffling efficiently?
Answer:
- Uses shuffle files written to local disk on executors.
- Shuffle service fetches files across the network.
- Can optimize by:
  - Increasing spark.sql.shuffle.partitions
  - Using map-side combine
  - Avoiding wide transformations if possible
 
### 21. What is the difference between SparkContext and SparkSession in PySpark?
Answer:
- SparkContext is the entry point for low-level RDD-based operations and was the main entry point before Spark 2.0.
- SparkSession (introduced in Spark 2.0) is a unified entry point that encapsulates SparkContext, SQLContext, and HiveContext under a single API.
- For modern PySpark applications, SparkSession is recommended because it supports both structured and unstructured processing in a single object.

### 22. How does PySpark convert a DataFrame operation into an execution plan?
Answer:

- It submits the stages to the Task Scheduler for execution.

### 24. What is the role of the Task Scheduler in Spark?
Answer:
- The Task Scheduler takes the stages from the DAG Scheduler and breaks them down into tasks, one per data partition.
- It assigns tasks to executors based on data locality and cluster resource availability.
- It doesn’t know about data dependencies—only executes given tasks.

### 25. Explain data locality levels in Spark execution.
Answer:
- Spark tries to execute tasks as close to the data as possible to reduce network overhead:
  - PROCESS_LOCAL – Same JVM as the data.
  - NODE_LOCAL – Same machine, different JVM.
  - RACK_LOCAL – Same rack, different node.
  - ANY – No locality preference, may require network transfer.
 
### 26. What are the different cluster managers supported by PySpark?
